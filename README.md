# 3D-Processing

This project is dedicated to building a simple 3D FPS engine in processing.
It's more of an experiment than something official so don't expect much.

## Controls
WASD to move
Mouse to turn
Q to move up
Z to move down (For testing)
L toggles mouselocking, so you can tab out



## File Naming Scheme

Name.pde - Main tab
C_Name.pde - Objects (that the player sees in the actual game)
D_Name.pde - Data storage
F_Name.pde - Functionality
N_Name.pde - Networking
P_Name.pde - Objects (that the player doesn't see)
S_Name.pde - States
T_Name.pde - Threads
V_Name.pde - Variables/Constants
Z_Name.pde - Work in progress (i.e. ignore)
